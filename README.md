## âœ¨ Recipes Search ##

This project is a simple Python command line tool that lets users search for recipes from the Edamam Recipe API. By entering a main ingredient, an optional course (like starter or dessert), and an optional cuisine type, the script fetches matching recipes and displays their names, ingredient lists, and source links directly in the terminal. It is designed for quick, interactive meal inspiration using real recipe data.
